**Project Description**

This project involved analyzing funding and payment data using Python. I imported funding and payment datasets, merged them on `fund_id`, and converted date columns to datetime format. I then calculated the total amount paid by month, compared it with the initial funding amount to determine outstanding balances, and visualized the data using various plots.

Key steps included:
- Merging datasets and processing dates.
- Aggregating payment totals and calculating outstanding balances.
- Generating statistical summaries and visualizing payment trends over time using histograms, line plots, and heatmaps.
- Analyzing seasonal patterns and payment behavior for individual merchants.
